  <h1>Linux Introduction </h1>
</div>
<p>This session concerns Linux, which is a common operating system. By
  operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer
  work. Linux is used by the workstations and multi-user servers within the
  school.</p>

<p> On X terminals and the workstations, X Windows provide a graphical
  interface between the user and Linux. However, knowledge of Linux is
  required for operations which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for
  when there is no X windows system, for example, in an <i>ssh</i>
  session. </p>

<h2>A note on use of the terms  <i>UNIX</i> and <i>Linux</i> herein... </h2>

<p>These tutorials occasionally refers to UNIX, which is an operating system
  that predates the Linux operating system that you are using. Linux provides,
  generally, the same facilities as UNIX. You can assume throughout these
  tutorials that when UNIX is mentioned, Linux is implied, or can be
  substituted. </p>

<h2>The Linux operating system </h2>

<p>The Linux operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell
  and the programs. </p>
<h3>The kernel </h3>
<p>The kernel of Linux is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time
  and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in
  response to system calls. </p>
<h3>The shell</h3>
<p>The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user
  logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts
  another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter
  (CLI).  It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them
  to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they
  terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt.</p>
<div class='hint'>The full prompt on our systems is a dollar sign, $, preceded
  by your user name, the name of the computer you happen to have connected to,
  and your current directory. It might look like this:
  <p style='margin-left:30px; font-weight:bold;' />jsmith@cs2:~$</p>
  Throughout this tutorial, the user name, computer name, and current
  directory will be excluded, and only the $ will be shown as the prompt. As
  you try out the tutorial examples, though, you will see the complete prompt.
</div>
<p> The adept user can customise his/her own shell, and users can use
  different shells on the same machine. Staff and students in the school have
  the "bourne again shell" (known as <i>bash</i>)  by default. </p>
<p> The bash shell has certain features to help the user inputting
commands.</p>
<p> Filename Completion - By typing part of the name of a command, filename or
  directory and pressing the [Tab] key, the bash shell will complete the rest
  of the name automatically. If the shell finds more than one name beginning
  with those letters you have typed, it will complete as many characters as
  are unique. You may then type a few more letters before pressing the tab key
  again. </p>
<p> History - The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you
  need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list
  or type history for a list of previous commands. </p>

<p> The shell and the kernel work together. As an illustration, suppose a user
  types <samp>rm myfile</samp> (which has the effect of removing the
  file <strong>myfile</strong>). The shell searches the filestore for the file
  containing the program <samp>rm</samp>, and then requests the kernel,
  through system calls, to execute the program <samp>rm</samp> on myfile. When
  the process
  <samp>rm myfile</samp> has finished running, the shell then returns the Linux 
  prompt $ to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands. </p>
    
<p> </p>
<h2>Files and processes </h2>
<p>Everything in Linux is either a file or a process. </p>
<p> A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process
identifier).
</p>
<p> A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text
  editors, running compilers etc. </p>
<p> Examples of files: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a document (report, essay etc.) </li>
  <li> the text of a program written in some high-level programming
  language such as C </li>
  <li> instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and
    incomprehensible to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary
    digits (an executable or binary file); </li>
  <li> a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a
    mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files. </li>
</ul>
  
<p> </p>
<h2>The Directory Structure </h2>
<p>All the files are grouped together in the directory structure. The
  file-system is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted
  tree. The top of the hierarchy is traditionally
  called <strong>root</strong>. </p>

</p>
<p> In the diagram above, we see that the directory ee51ab contains the
  subdirectory unixstuff and a file proj.txt</p>
  
<h2>Starting an Xterminal session </h2>
<h4>FIXME: replace these images and text</h4>

<p>To start an Xterm session, click on the Unix Terminal icon on your desktop,
or from the drop-down menus</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="unixterminal.jpg" alt="The Unix Terminal icon" />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> An Xterminal window will appear with a Unix prompt, waiting for you to
  start entering commands.</p>
